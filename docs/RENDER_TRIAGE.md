# Render triage

What the whole corpus draws through the generic driver, and the categories the
failures fall into. Regenerate with:

```powershell
./scripts/render_survey.ps1              # numbers + corpus/_timeline/<slug>/
./scripts/render_survey.ps1 -Diagnose    # + heartbeat detail, ~10x slower
./scripts/render_survey.ps1 -Press ""    # survey with no input injected
```

Each ROM boots headless for 900 frames and is sampled at frames 300, 600 and
900. The verdict is read off those screenshots (a blank 384x224 frame is an
all-black PNG of exactly 3,619 bytes), not off a debug counter — so it does not
depend on running the game slowly enough for the heartbeat to print, which is
what used to make this survey disagree with `build_all.ps1`.

## Where the corpus stands

| | Count | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Advancing | 28 | The frame changes between samples: the game is running. |
| Drawing, then frozen | 13 | One image, byte-identical at 300/600/900. |
| Nothing on screen | 34 | Every sample blank; no character data ever written. |

"Renders something" is 41/76, but that number is the less useful of the two:
a game frozen on a correctly-drawn warning screen counts as rendering and is
not running. **Advancing** is the number to drive.

## Categories

### 1. Nobody was pressing anything — resolved, 6 → 27 advancing

The retail set gates its health-warning screen on a button. Waterworld's own
boot code reads the pad through `sub_07E00C96` (write `0x84` to SCR, spin on
SCR bit 1, read SDLR/SDHR), masks the result with `0x303C` — `VB_BTN_A | B |
RT | LT | STA | SEL` — and waits for a *rising edge*:

```
07E00FCC: ld.h  40[r3], r10    ; previous sample
07E00FD0: andi  0x303C, r10, r10
07E00FD4: bz    0x07E00FDA     ; only if nothing was held before
07E00FDA: ld.h  36[r3], r10    ; current sample
07E00FDE: andi  0x303C, r10, r10
07E00FE2: bgt   0x07E00FE8     ; ...and something is held now
```

A headless run pressing nothing never produces that edge. This is not a
recompiler fault — the game is correctly waiting for a player. The survey now
holds `0x303C` in bursts (`VBRECOMP_PRESS`, `-Press`), which took the corpus
from 6 games advancing to 27, and Waterworld from a frozen warning screen
through its auto-pause option screen into the round HUD.

The earlier suspicion that this was the VIP interrupt path was wrong: the VIP
handler fires (300+ times per run, no SP leak), and the two WRAM addresses the
game reads two million times are its own pad-state slots, not an interrupt flag.

### 2. Mario Clash: SCR's start bit had to read back set — resolved

Two idioms arm a pad read, and only one survives a register that reads back
what was stored:

```
Waterworld:   ld.b SCR; ori  0x0084; st.b SCR   -- sets the start bit
Mario Clash:  ld.h SCR; andi 0x0084; st.h SCR   -- keeps the start bit
```

Mario Clash's read-modify-write only arms if `SCR_START` is already there. Its
init leaves SCR at `0x80`, so `0x80 & 0x84` wrote `0x80` forever and the buttons
were never latched — it read zero 161,598 times a run while its 64-entry jump
table sat at state 2 testing `pad & 0x303C0000`. SCR now reads back with the
start bit set; Mario Clash reaches its OPTION / AUTOMATIC PAUSE screen and
Waterworld, which never depended on the read-back, is unchanged.

`VBRECOMP_PEEK=<hex>[,<hex>...]` was added for this: the hot-read list gives the
address and `VBRECOMP_WATCH` gives the reader, but for a state variable the
*value* is the question.

### 3. movbsu wrote to address zero — resolved

The bit-string block copy takes its addresses in r29/r30 and its bit offsets in
r26/r27. The first implementation had them inverted, so every blit read and
wrote near address zero: scribbling on the left framebuffer while the real
destination stayed empty — worse than the no-op it replaced. Golf makes 1.2
million trips through its copy helper (`sub_07E0E4D0`, a `movbsu` wrapper) and
still reported `CHR=0/0`.

The conformance cases had passed while agreeing with the same wrong belief, so
the assignment now comes from ROM: Golf loads `r29 = r6; r26 = (r6 & 3) << 3`
and `r30 = r7; r27 = (r7 & 3) << 3`, pairing each address with the offset from
its own low two bits, and Ballface blits with a word-aligned source (`r27 = 0`)
and a variable destination bit position (`r26 = r5`), a glyph's x.

### 4. Running, but the state machine never advances — 13 games

3-D BattleSnake, BLOX 2, Ballface, Bound High, Nester's Funky Bowling, Panic
Bomber, SD Gundam, Teleroboxer, Tobidase! Panibon, Tron VB and V-Tetris still
sit on one frame with the buttons held. This is *not* a second button gate —
five masks were tried (`303C`, `1000`, `0004`, `0010`, `F03C`) and Teleroboxer
and Panic Bomber produce a byte-identical frame under every one, out to 6,000
frames.

They are not deadlocked either. Mario Clash's hot address resolves (via
`VBRECOMP_WATCH=0500FFC8`) to `sub_07FF5BB6`, the standard VB frame-sync idiom:

```
07FF5BA4: loop1: r10 = XPSTTS; if ((r10 & 0x000C) == 0) goto loop1   ; wait for draw start
07FF5BB6: loop2: r10 = XPSTTS; if ((r10 & 0x000C) != 0) goto loop2   ; wait for draw end
```

Both halves terminate — `vb_vip_read16` already cycles XPBSY through
F0 / F1 / both / idle for exactly this reason — so the game reaches its main
loop every frame and simply redraws the same screen.

What separates this group from Waterworld is `INTENB`: Mario Clash and
Teleroboxer run with `INTENB=0000`, VIP interrupts never enabled, driven only
by the timer (`TCR=0B`, level 1 firing 500 times a run). Waterworld runs with
`INTENB=4000`. V-Tetris (`INTENB=4008`, `INTPND=3036` — its handler *is*
clearing XPEND) does advance, just slowly enough that a 900-frame sample misses
it. So the next thing to establish for this group is why VIP interrupts are
never enabled: whether the game is waiting on a condition before enabling them,
or an `INTENB` write is not reaching the register.

### 5. Polling a display phase that never arrives — part of the 34 blanks

Golf reads `DPSTTS` (0x0005F820) 1,248,381 times and writes no character data
at all (`CHR=0/0`). `vb_vip_frame_advance()` toggles the display status bits
rather than cycling them through the real phase sequence, so a game waiting on
a specific phase order waits forever. Space Squash and Elevated Speed show the
same shape.

### 6. Garbled second character set

Bound High and V-Tetris render the English warning text correctly and the
Japanese text below it as wrong tiles. One character set lands and the other
does not, so this is the transfer of a specific tile range — not the renderer,
which is drawing exactly what it was given.

### 7. Partial glyph rows

Tron VB draws the top strokes of its logo and loses the bottoms. Hamburgers
renders a full bitmap title correctly but corrupts the small text at bottom
left. Rows within a tile are being dropped.

### 8. World placement

V-Tetris draws its text block flush left where it should be centred; SD Gundam
has a column of stray tiles down the left edge. Waterworld's round HUD renders
but its play field is empty. World X/Y or BGMap offsets are wrong for some
worlds and right for others in the same frame.

## What is already ruled out

- **Unimplemented calls.** Stub functions, unfound JAL callees and unresolved
  indirect jumps are counted at run time (`vb_recomp_stub`, printed by the
  heartbeat). The stalled games sampled so far hit none of them.
- **The VIP interrupt path**, at least for Waterworld: the handler is
  registered, fires, and returns without leaking the stack.
- **Instruction semantics** for everything `tools/conformance.py` covers: the
  ALU and its flags, immediate sign- vs zero-extension, shifts and their
  carry-out, the 64-bit multiply/divide register pair, every `setf` condition,
  load sign-extension, the float unit, the bit-string block copy, and
  branch/call/return shapes.
